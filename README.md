Bin Packing -- Haskell module
=============================

I created this small Haskell module in order to learn Haskell, especially the
Data.List module.

It provides implementation of most important algorithms for Bin Packing.

Usage
-----

The demo can be directly run; with GHC the _runhaskell_ command may be used:

    runhaskell Demo.hs

The BinPacking module itself can either be imported the way it is done in Demo.hs or run
interactively. In GHCi you would simply write this command:

    :load BinPacking
